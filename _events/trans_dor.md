The Transgender Day of Remembrance is a day set aside to remember transgender people who have been taken from us by anti-transgender violence. The Maple City GMB is hosting a small service to remember the countless transgender people that have been murdered, including over 350 in the past year.

The event will be live-streamed on our [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/MapleCity7/). Email us at <mailto:IWW.MapleCity.GMB@protonmail.com> ([public key](/assets/keys/publickey.IWW.MapleCity.GMB@protonmail.com.asc)) if you would like to join the zoom link.
