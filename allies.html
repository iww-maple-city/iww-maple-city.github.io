<h2><a href="https://idocwatch.org">IDOCWatch</a></h2> 
<br>
The mission of IDOCWatch is to bridge the gap between outside activists and those in prisons fighting for change. They report on the many abuses of the Indiana Department of Corrections and work to build an movement toward abolition of the prison-industrial complex. While they do not view reforms as a means of eliminating the systematic violence against prisoners, they do work towards certain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-reformist_reform"> non-reformist reforms </a>. These can help create the conditions for revolutionary, abolitionist action, but are the start, not the end, of the work.
