The General Defense Committee (GDC) is organizing to unite the working class against attacks from the police, bigots, bosses, and landlords.<br>
<br>
Those who attack us use racism, sexism, homophobia, and other forms of discrimination to keep us divided. When we’re apart, they can more easily defeat us one by one. If we all come together, we will be better able to defend ourselves and each other. This is called “community self-defense.”<br>
<br>
Through community self-defense, we have the power to fight police brutality, gentrification, and other problems in our neighborhoods—right here, right now, without politicians, lawyers, or anyone else.<br>
